          In Hinduism, consulting an auspicious time or muhurat before
          commencing any big task, yagna, ritual or ceremony is practiced since
          ancient times. It holds a great significance during the time of
          marriage, fasting during festivals or conducting yagna for a ritual.
          Carrying out the ritual during this period ensures happiness,
          affluence and compatibility. It tells about both favorable
          (choghadiya, hora) to unfavorable time periods (rahu kaal) based on
          the position of constellations in the universe and time of sunrise and
          sunset.

          Muhurat is said to be a combination of a specific date, time and day
          auspicious to carry out any activity. Hindu Panchang specifies a day
          and date when a festival occurs, and during those hours, muhurat
          represents that specific auspicious period during which a native can
          carry out the rituals, puja or hawans to attain maximum benefits. A
          combination of Vaar (day), Nakshatra (stars), Tithi (date), Karan, Yog
          in a Panchang (Hindu calendar) makes up for a favorable time to recite
          the mantra, start the fast or worship on the day of festival. Muhurat
          proves to be very useful for natives who have lost or do not have
          their kundli or birth chart and need remedies to get rid of malefic
          effects of planets or doshas. One attains maximum results during an
          auspicious muhurat.
