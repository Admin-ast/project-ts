              Asthmi is the day of Goddess Durga and is associated with the
              fierce armed war. On this day one can weaponize self for
              self-protection. Countries can buy new weapons to strengthen the
              armed forces for the sake of enhancing the self-protection of the
              country from the outside forces etc.
