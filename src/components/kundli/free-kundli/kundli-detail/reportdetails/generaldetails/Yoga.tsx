              <p>Adhi Yoga is a Vedic Combination that forms in the horoscope when the three benefic planets, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury, are present in the 6th, 7th or 8th house from the Moon. The presence of this special Yoga is significant as it brings happiness and stability in the nativeâ€™s life. This Yoga elevates the joy in life with sudden riches, promotion, better ability to inspire trust and respect in others. It also leads to a substantial increase in benign and philanthropic nature. </p>

              <p>So Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus these three natural benefic planets should be placed each in Lagna or in 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th or 10th house from Ascendant and Jupiter must be strong either by exaltation or my own sign or by vargottama. Results of this Yoga is so wonderful that it is one of my personal favorite Planetary Union. </p>
