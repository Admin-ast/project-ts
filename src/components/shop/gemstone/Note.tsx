            If there is one piece of jewellery that looks endearing, doesn’t
            hurt the economy (when you purchase and stack it) and doesn’t look
            too much when you don it, then it has to be a gemstone on a ring.
            Gemstones are precious mineral crystals that have a history of
            billions of years carved on their aesthetics. In astrology,
            Gemstones are said to hold a reserve of energies, which entwine with
            the four elements in astrology - Water, Fire, Air, Earth - apart
            from many other astrological aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best thing about gemstones is the fact that you don’t need a
            reason to wear them. A Gemstone can be worn by most people and does
            not do any harm. However, exceptions are always present and thus you
            must always take the advice of astrologers on which, and when to
            wear a Gemstone. To be specific about it, gemstones can be divided
            into categories based on planets, ascendant sign, and area of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            To elaborate, each zodiac sign is ruled by a planet. For example if
            your zodiac sign is Taurus, you are ruled by the Venus sign. Based
            on this, in astrology, there is a specific gemstone for the Venus
            zodiac sign. And also, there would be a gemstone that the Venus born
            should never wear. If you wear a gemstone that represents Venus, it
            will further strengthen the influence of the planet in your life.
            Talking about strength, your life is the result of the influence of
            all the planets in astrology. Each planet in astrology influences a
            certain period of your life. Simlairy, planets also camp different
            houses in your kundli.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a planet is positively camped in your kundli, you will see an
            abundance of luck favouring you and you achieving prosperity in
            life. However, if any planet is maflice in your chart, it coils
            bring with it all sorts of misery and pain in your life. Thus this
            is when astrologers mostly recommend either to wear a gemstone
            representing the malefic planet or stay away from it. Doing so helps
            in ensuring that you are able to counter the harmful effects of the
            planet or at least lessen them so that they don’t hurt you in any
            possible way. Moreover, gemstones are also recommended based on your
            one’s ascendant. For the ones who don’t know what an ascendant is,
            it’s simply the zodiac sign in the first house of your kundli at the
            time. In Astrology, each one of the 12 Ascendant Signs is ruled by a
            specific planet. All the Ascendant Signs have their own set of
            distinct characteristics and these are because of the different
            natures of their ruling planets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, gemstones are also recommended based on the area of life.
            For example, if you are facing issues in terms of your finances,
            then there are specific gemstones for that reason. Similarly if
            facing issues in terms of relationship, the astrologers would
            recommend gemstones that can better your partnership with your
            spouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, only knowing what gemstone to wear is not enough. When it
            comes to wearing a gemstone, firstly you need to find the accurate
            metal to embed it in because simply can’t embed it in any metal you
            like as it could lead to harming you. If you ever ask our
            astrologers, they will tell you how all gemstones are either high or
            low on energy. To balance the power of this energy, it is
            recommended that they are worn with specific metal. For example when
            it comes to wearing a pearl it is said that the best metal to wear
            pearls with is silver. Wearing a pearl with Gold is also fine but
            silver can better balance the pearl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, some gemstones need to be dipped in either water or honey
            before wearing them to charge them so they can work for you. Talking
            about charge, you also can’t go on wearing gemstones for 108 years
            and expect it to work. Our astrologers would tell you how, like
            everything else, gemstones lose their aura after a particular point
            of time. However, only astrologers can detail about that time. Now
            that you know how gemstones are really a saviour, you might be
            wanting to get them for yourself. However, these gemstones are rare
            objects hence can get quite expensive. Thus if you ever wish to buy
