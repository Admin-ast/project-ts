                Monkey is the ninth Chinese zodiac sign. 2028 will be the year
                of the Monkey. People belonging to the Chinese zodiac sign are
                said to be very active, quick-witted, smart, humorous, sociable,
                capable and brave. Monkey zodiac sign natives are known for
                their quick learning skills. The Monkey personality has numerous
                interests in life and if you are friends with them, you ought to
                remain busy in activities that you will love to be a part of. In
                a nutshell, you will have new hobbies to work on. The weakness
                of the Monkey zodiac is that they do not usually understand the
                feelings of others. They are also very restless in nature and
                outgoing. They can get very impatient with life, which is not a
                virtue. The Monkey horoscope tells us that the opportunistic
                native can also sometimes use emotion as a tool to lure you and
                get their work done. In love, the Monkey natives are not very
                quick to settle down. They get bored with people easily and thus
                can not easily find for themselves one they can settle around
                with. However, since Monkeys are sociable and love to talk, it
                is easy to relate to them.
