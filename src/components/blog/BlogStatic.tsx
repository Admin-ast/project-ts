              In Vedic astrology, Mangal Dosha happens by the placement of Mars
              in certain positions in a person’s birth chart. This dosha can
              have negative effects on the marital life of the person, leading
              to conflicts, misunderstandings, and even divorce. Here are some
              common planetary combinations that can result in Mangal Dosha:

              overall strength of the horoscope. The presence of Mangal Dosha in
              a girl’s horoscope can result in problems. These problems can
              include delays in marriage, frequent quarrels, and even separation

              specific gemstone such as coral, and observing fasts on Tuesdays.
              Astrology recommends the matching of the horoscope of the girl
              with a boy who also has Mangal Dosha or with a boy whose horoscope
              has a strong Mars.

            <p className="">
              In Vedic astrology, Mangal dosha is a crucial factor in horoscope
              matching before marriage. The placement of Mars or Mangal in
              certain houses in a person’s birth chart can cause the Mangal
              dosha. If a person has Mangal dosha in their horoscope, they are
              called Manglik. Mangal dosha is of utmost importance in horoscope
              matching. If a Manglik person marries a non-Manglik person, it can
              lead to conflicts, misunderstandings, and even separation or
              divorce. The placement of Mars in the first, second, fourth,
              seventh, eighth, or twelfth house of a person’s horoscope can
              cause the Mangal dosha. When a Manglik person marries a
              non-Manglik person, the non-Manglik person will have the negative
              energy of Mars, leading to conflicts and problems in the marriage.
              However, it is important to note that not all Manglik persons
              experience negative effects in their marriage. The severity of the
              dosha depends on the placement of Mars and other factors in the
              horoscope, as well as the remedies performed to mitigate its
              effects. To avoid the negative effects of Mangal dosha, it is
              important to match the horoscopes of prospective partners before
              marriage. If both partners are Manglik, the negative effects of
              Mangal dosha can cancel. Additionally, certain remedies such as
              reciting mantras, wearing specific gemstones, performing pujas,
              and conducting other rituals reduce the negative effects of Mangal
              dosha.

              In Vedic astrology, Mangal Dosha or Manglik Dosha is a planetary
              condition that can affect a person’s married life. It occurs when
              Mars (Mangal) is located in the first, second, fourth, seventh,
              eighth, or twelfth house of a person’s horoscope. The effects of
              Mangal Dosha can be reduced or nullified by specific astrological
              remedies or by finding a partner with the same condition. Here are
              some ways to determine if your Mangal Dosha is canceled:
