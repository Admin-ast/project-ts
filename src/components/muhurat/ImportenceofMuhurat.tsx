                {` Why is picking an opportune moment to begin any new task seen so
                important? Everybody wants to succeed in their endeavours,
                whether it be a profession, starting a business, getting
                married, or house events like naming ceremonies or annaprashan.
                As a result, the individual gave the assurance that doing the
                aforementioned activity at the fortunate moment would bring them
                success and riches. Therefore, we preferred to complete any
                tasks during Shubh Muhurta, which was determined based on the
                positions of the planets and constellations. Consequently,
                choosing an auspicious period is important. Since the beginning
                of time, people have observed fortunate periods. It holds that
                starting a project at a fortunate moment increases the
                likelihood of success and ensures that it will be completed
                smoothly and without incident. A "Shubh Muhurat" is a moment
                when it is considered auspicious to begin any endeavour when all
                of the planets and nakshatras are in favourable positions.`}

                However, the present generation frequently disregards these
                fortunate periods, which prevents them from achieving the
                necessary success in their profession. Even their success rate
                declines, and their growth is sluggish. One of the main causes
                of this, according to astrologers, is starting work before the
                lucky hour. There are several verses in the Bible that discuss
                how Shubh Muhurta is determined and chosen, as well as its
                significance. How can the average individual determine if an
                identified Muhurta is lucky or unlucky? Which direction to
                select the lucky time. Therefore, please explain the process for
                calculating Shubh Muhurta as well as the key considerations for
                2023.
