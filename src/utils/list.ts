Similarly, all the letters combined in P, O, O, J, and A will bring the respective numbers 16,15,15,10, and 1.  You now simply need to add all these numbers as 16+15+15+10+1= 57 as the final number from the name. Both 5 and 7 digits from the number 57 need to be added which will make 5+7= 12 as the final lucky number.",
