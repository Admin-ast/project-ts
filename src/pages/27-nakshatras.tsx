            {`Nakshatra is the familiar terminology in Vedic astrology which holds
            immense significance. It is the term that is used to denote the
            Lunar mansion or the place where the moon places itself for about a
            day. The lunar mansion can be divided into 4 parts or the quarter
            called Pada. The length of each pada is 3"20 long while the whole
            lunar mansion is about 13°20 in length. In the c astrology, the
            Nakshatras are considered to be highly prominent since it is
            associated with the Natal symbol of the moon. With the same
            associated the moon takes 28 days to move into a zodiac sign and
            marks its stay for the 2,3 days in the sign. Moon is the ruler of
            all the Nakshatras and thus these Nakshatras can largely determine
            the life predictions of the native.`}

            In Vedic astrology, the whole concept of Nakshatras is highly
            crucial in the context of making the life prediction for the native.
            The term Nakshatra has been originated from the Naksha+ star which
            stands for the map and the star. It simply interprets the Nakshatras
            as the map of stars which reveals everything about the personality
            of the individual and makes life predictions. In other words, the
            Nakshatra can be considered as the map of stars or the celestial
            bodies which influence and predict the events happening in our
            lives. It can thus be concluded that Nakshatras comprises the whole
            essence of Vedic astrology in all its aspects. The implication of
            Nakshatra has been prominent in Vedic astrology since the ancient
            times of Rig Veda. There are officially the 27 Nakshatras or the
            constellations that form part of the Yajurveda and the Atharva Veda.

            These are the official 27 Nakshatras that are broadly recognized and
            acknowledged in astrology. Every zodiac sign from the 12 is born
            under the specific Nakshatra which is relevant to make the life
            prediction for such zodiac sign native. Furthermore, the Nakshatras
            can also be divided in the form of male and female Nakshatras. The
            male Nakshatras are generally the more enthusiastic and dominating
            ones in comparison to female Nakshatras. On the other hand, the
            female Nakshatras have a similar tendency in their temperament and
            overall behaviour.

            Well, the Nakshatras and the zodiac signs are two different things
            they both complement each other in Vedic astrology. It can be
            understood in the chronology that if you divide or split the sky
            into 12 different parts then you get to have the 12 zodiac signs. On
            the other hand, if you split the sky in the 27 parts then there
            comes the 27 Nakshatras. Both the zodiac sign and the Nakshatras are
            relevant to know the specific characteristics of an {`individual's`}
            personality. Zodiac sign is a broad term which is determined only
            after considering the Nakshatra of the native The Nakshatra can
            reveal a lot more than the zodiac sign and help an astrologer to
            make the life prediction for the native. Nakshatra can also indicate
            and reveal the four aims of an individual life which are the Dharma,
            Artha, Kama and the Mosha. The life of any human revolves around
            these four aims and thus with the Nakshatra one can figure out the
            destined aims of life.

            Nakshatras can be considered as the whole essence of Vedic astrology
            to make all types of life predictions for the natives. In other
            words, the Nakshatras work like the raw map of natives life to make
            an accurate interpretation of the life of the natives. Simply put by
            using the Nakshatra an astrologer can predict the personality of the
            native such as the bodily structure of the native, how the native
            thinks/perceives life and the overall objective of the natives life.
            All these aspects are highly crucial in Vedic astrology to determine
            the essence of a natives personality. An astrologer always considers
            the Nakshatra readings to make the life prediction for the native.
            With the help of Nakshatras, an astrologer can figure out the ruling
            deity to find out the core traits of a{` native's`} personality.
            This is the reason why Nakshatras play a crucial role in Vedic
            astrology for both the native and the astrologer as well.
