            Both the bride and the groom have no mangal dosh, but the overall
            matching points represent an average match. Marriage is preffered
            but only after consulting an astrologer on how to make the most out
            of this pair combination.Both boy and girl are not Manglik, which
            does not lead to any problems.Although Girl is manglik but it is
            getting cancelled due to the following reasons: â–  Mars is combusted
            by Sun.
