            How Does Namkaran Muhurat Work ?
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            In c astrology, the concept of the Namkaran muhurat is ages old and
            has been used since the Vedic era. The reasoning behind the namakran
            muhurat is simple this period denotes the auspicious timing of the
            period. This auspicious timing is ideal to name the kids
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            An astrologer while determining the Namakran muhurat generally digs
            deeper into the planetary position of the celestial bodies. The
            astrologer specifies the period during which it is ideal to begin
            any auspicious event and namkaran or the naming ceremony is one such
            event. The Nakshatras, yogas dasha etc are the other key factors
            which are also taken into consideration during the namkaran muhurat
            determination. Once the astrologer suggests the namkaran muhurat
            then the natives can simply hold the naming ceremony event on that
            particular date and the time etc.

            Why is Namakran Muhurat Significant?
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Well, the namkaran muhurat is significant for the obvious reason
            that naming{` one's`} child during this period is associated with
            the favourable future of the kid. In Vedic astrology, the birth
            details including the name of the kid play a significant role in
            determining the overall future of the child. For the same reason if
            the name of the child has been given by the shubh muhrat then it
            will certainly bless the child with favorable results in the future.
            This is the reason why the Namkaran Murat holds immense significance
            in Hinduism across the country.
