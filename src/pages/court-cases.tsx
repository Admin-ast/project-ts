            Getting stuck into the court cases or the litigation is simply the
            nightmare for any of us and sadly the court cases these days are
            increasing with the significant pace. It is the endless loop that
            not only drains the person financially but also mentally. The life
            becomes walking around the court waiting for the favourable verdict
            but often things get rather worse. This is when the natives seek the
            alternatives to get out of the court cases in the smoothest and
            quickest manner possible.

            Astrological Insight on the Court Cases{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Well in the astrology everything is rooted from the influence of the
            celestial bodies movements. The movement of these planets have the
            sheer influence on all the events that happen in our lives including
            the court cases. More often then not it is the movement or the onset
            of some inauspicious or the unfavourable planets that bring the
            court cases and the litigations in the lie of native. If the planets
            are unfavourable then even unwillingly some events will happen in
            the life of native that will bring the court cases to trap the
            native. At the same time as there are thw two sides of the coins and
            in the similar manner astrology has the potential to also provide
            the astrological remedies to get out of all the court cases.

            Planets Causing the Court Cases{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            As per the core fundamental of the astrology there is always the
            placement of the planets that cause the happening of certain events
            in our lives. Similarly the inauspicious happening of the events
            like the court cases is caused by the ill placement of some certain
            planets. Here below we are putting the brief information of some
            aspects in the birthchart of native that causes the court cases.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[15px] mb-[15px] text-[18px] font-bold">
            ● The Chronic Rahu
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Rahu is generally considered maleific when it is putting itself in
            the wrong house within the birthchart of native. Such placement of
            Rahu can cause the numbers of the difficulties for the native. Most
            importantly it creates the high probability of the events like the
            sudden onset of the court cases in the context of marriage, business
            and even the education.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[15px] mb-[15px] text-[18px] font-bold">
            ● Malefic Saturn
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Saturn is the planet that renders the intense outcome whether{" "}
            {`it's`} positive or the negative. If unfortunately Saturn is
            maleific to the native then it create the hurdles of the court cases
            involving the certain aspects of {`native's`} life. Not just the
            hurdle rather Saturn also delays the verdict of the court cases to
            trigger the things more.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[15px] mb-[15px] text-[18px] font-bold">● Mars</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            The maleific placement of Mars will although not induce the
            beginning of the court cases but it will certainly delay your
            freedom from the court cases. Mars generally stretches and delays
            the court cases to the indefinite period. This can potentially
            enhance and prolong the suffering of native who are already dealing
            with the complex court cases such as in the marriage, or business
            etc.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[15px] mb-[15px] text-[18px] font-bold">● Ketu</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            The inauspicious placement of the Ketu in your birthchart will bring
            the possibilities of court cases involving the money. This could
            possibly be any fraud in the business or the such other disputes in
            the business deals with the other clients or business partners. An
            astrologer can precisely predict the impact of poorly placed Ketu in
            your birthchart for the better clarity of its impact.
