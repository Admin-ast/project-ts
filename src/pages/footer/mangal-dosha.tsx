          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Mangal dosha is the unfavourable placement of Mars in{` one's`}{" "}
            birth chart within specific houses. This particular placement of the
            mars is what creates the Mangal dosha and is believed to bring the
            numbers of the negative impact. Mangal dosha is considered to be
            highly inauspicious in the marriage prospects. If the placement of
            the mars falls into the lagna chart then there is the direct
            presence of mangal dosha in the marriage prospects. A person with
            the Mangal dosha in the lagna chart is supposed to marry only the
            person who also has the magal dosha present in the lagna chart.
            However, some several remedies or solutions can help curb and
            eliminate mangal dosha depending upon its severity. One can chat

          <p className=" text-3xl font-bold">Why Does Mangal Dosha Happen?</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Well, the mangal dosha being the highly inauspicious dosha has its
            core foundation. In the Vedicrology and the u mythology the planet
            Marsis becomes to the natives when it falls in the 1st, 4th, 7th and
            8th or 12th house of the native. It is the influence of the mars in
            all these houses that makes it prominently inauspicious in certain
            aspects of marriage. It is essential that for the mangal dosha to
            happen the placement of Mars in all these houses must be at the time
            of the {`native's`} birth. The subsequent movement of the mars in
            these houses {`doesn't`} count as the Mangal dosha. The native who
            are born with the mangal dosha has the other certain characteristics
            in their personality. They are generally very aggressive and
            vindictive in their whole personality lacking politeness. These
            natives are also very dominating and lack politeness in their
            behaviour while dealing with others. All these aspects make the
            mangal dosha the most feared one and it stands truly apart from all
            the other dosha in Vedic astrology.
