          <p className=" text-3xl font-bold">What is the Solar Eclipse?</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            In simple language, a Solar eclipse is the phenomenon where the moon
            moves between the sun and the earth covering the light of the sun on
            a temporary basis. The moon works as the obscuration to hide the
            {`sun's `}light from the exposure of the earth which causes a
            temporary dark aura over the surface of the earth. The intensity of
            the solar eclipse decides how dark it gets over the earth depending
            upon to what extent the moon cover the soon. Also, the duration of
            the solar eclipse differs each time and can be either of few seconds
            or minutes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Solar eclipses can be categorized as partial, total, and annual
            eclipses. This phenomenon {`doesn't`} have any fixed timing of
            occurrence and can take place at any random moment. However,
            Astronomy science can predict the dates and timing of solar eclipses
            well in advance since {`it's`} the mere rotation of the moon sun,
            and earth.

            Significance of Solar Eclipse in Vedic Astrology ( Surya Grahan)
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            A solar eclipse is observed from a different perspective in the
            Vedic astrology and the Hindu traditional culture than the general
            scientific perspective. For the ages, a Solar eclipse is considered
            to be a highly inauspicious omen in Vedic astrology with its
            implications for our lives. It is believed that the Solar eclipse is
            caused by the evil shadows of the Rahu and Ketu planets. These
            planets tend to take revenge on both the moon and the sun and thus
            bring them together in such a position where they outshine each
            other.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            The impact of the same is borne by the earth as well since the earth
            gets deprived of both the sun and the moonlight. The same evil
            shadow of the Rahu and Ketu causes a highly bad omen to the earth as
            well. This is the core perception and the belief of ancient Vedic
            astrology of solar eclipse and is widely believed across the Hindu
            culture.

            Precautions in the Solar Eclipse
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            As we have mentioned above as per the Vedic astrology in Hindu
            culture the period of Solar eclipse is said to be bringing a bad
            omen. In fact, the whole phenomenon of solar eclipse is not
            advisable to be seen with the bare eyes. It is simply for the reason
            that there is technically no sun and the moonlight at that point of
            time and the darker shadow can hurt the eyesight. Secondly in the
            Vedic culture belief, {`it's`} advisable that one should not
            commence or do any significant task in the period of Solar eclipse
            and should rather take a break until the eclipse ends.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Furthermore cooking and food consumption is also not advisable
            during this period. The whole reasoning behind such a precaution is
            that since there is no presence of the sun and the moon anything
            done during this period {`can't`} reach or bring the ideal or the
            auspicious outcome. All of the new ventures and significant
            activities should be done when there is the presence of either the
            sun or the moonlight so as to bring positive outcomes.

            The solar eclipse is a significant phenomenon and is considered
            highly cautious in Vedic astrology. The eclipse in general brings
            the bad omens for the majority of the natives in the various aspects
            of life. Health is one of the significant aspects of life that may

            ● Pregnant ladies are highly advised not to expose themselves to the
            rays of the solar eclipse. It is found and believed that the direct
            exposure of the eclipse rays can adversely affect the pregnancy in a
            cruel manner. It can possibly affect the health of the child and can
            also affect the chances of normal delivery.

            ● The solar eclipse {`shouldn't`} be seen with the naked eye as it
            can cause potential damage to the eyesight. It is simply for the
            reason that during the solar eclipse, there is no availability of

            even found that body gets the digestive and other issues after heavy
