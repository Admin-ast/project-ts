            Pitra dosha is often termed as the curse from forefathers and often
            we begin to have hatred even to our ancestors. However, in reality,
            the Pitra dosha is never a curse from the forefathers rather{" "}
            {`it's`}
            the karmic debt towards the forefathers or the ancestors. Pitra
            dosha is one of the well-renowned malefic planetary combinations in
            the birth chart of the native. A native with the Pitra dosha in the
            birth chart is indebted to certain deeds either of the ancestors or
            of his/her own towards the ancestors. This is the debt that has to
            be paid by the native having the pirtra dosha in the birth chart. At
            Astrosevatalk we give due weightage to the pitra dosha causes and
            its remedies. We are committed to sorting out all types of
            raying-ray dosha from the birth chart of the natives with the help
            of our proficient astrologers.{" "}

          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            A pitta dosha is the ill karmic dosha present in the birth chart of
            the native. This dosha represents the certain debts coming from the
            ancestors to the next generation. Simply put the Pitra dosha can
            arise either for the wrong deeds done by the forefathers to the
            others or the wrong deeds done by the next generation towards the
            forefathers. In both of these scenarios, the native can be born
            having the pitta dosha in the birth chart. It is extremely important
            to pay off the karmic debts either of the {`ancestor's`} or the
            {` native's`}
            own to get over the pitta dosha.
