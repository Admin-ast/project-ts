            The Kundali milan in simple language can be defined as checking the
            compatibility match between the two individuals from the point of
            astrology view. Here an astrologer takes into consideration the deep
            birth chart details of both the natives and the position of the
            planets in their birth. After the careful analysis of the birthchart
            for both the natives the astrologer makes the final interpretation
            of the marriage compatibility between the natives. Here the
            astrologer takes into consideration the placement of planets in all
            12th houses of the natives. There are 36 guns in a total of these 12
            houses and it is believed that there has to be a minimum of 18 guna
            matches to proceed for a healthy marriage ahead.

            Why is Kundali Milan Necessary?{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Well as per the astrology, the two natives in any long-term
            relationship like marriage come with the influences of the different
            celestial bodies or the planets upon them. This difference sometimes
            can make a healthy match of environment between them and sometimes
            it can also create an enemy scenario. In the Kundali Milan, Milathe
            astrologer studies the deep analysis of all the planets in the birth
            chart of the natives and interprets how the placement of the planets
            complements each other. This complement addresses the various
            aspects of the areas in their lives such as health, romantic life,
            finances, mutual understanding, love and support etc. If there is
            the bare minimum compatibility found between both the Kundali then
            it becomes a positive or the auspicious match for the marriage. On
            the other hand, if there is no bare minimum compatibility found then
            an astrologer will generally not approve of the marriage.
