            The immense pressure of appearing in the exams and then hanging
            around the results is the most extreme phase of any student's life.
            It is the relentless struggle on the head of the student's shoulders
            that they have to overcome to succeed in exams and life. The life of
            a student is never easy since they have to keep themselves hanging
            in the constant phase of the sheer struggle with only the hope of
            success. Many times the majority of students end up struggling whole
            their lives without tasting the share of success that they truly
            deserve. This is disheartening for both the students as well as for
            their parents to cope with.

            How Does Astrology Work in Educational/Examination Success
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            As we know Astrology solely relies on the position of the celestial
            bodies to interpret any kind of prediction for the several areas of
            native's life. Education is no exception since astrology has a sheer
            influence on the educational success of the native. There are
            several parameters that are checked by the astrologer to make the
            educational prediction for the native. All these parameters lie and
            begin in the birthchart of the native considering the position of
            the various planets in the concerned educational house of the
            native.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            An astrologer generally predicts the examination success of the
            native by analyzing certain aspects of the birth chart, such as the
            positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets in relevant houses or signs.
            Here below are some of the key parameters or the aspects that an
            astrologer checks to make examination success predictions for the
            natives.

            ● Assessment of 10th House
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Well in astrology the 10th house is one of the most significant
            houses when it comes to determining the professional success of the
            native. 10th house often relates to {`one's`} career and public
            life. Astrologers might examine the planetary positions and aspects
            in this house to gain insights into a person's potential for success
            in exams or their chosen field.

            ● The Progressions and Transit of Planets
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            An astrologer always looks at and considers the current planetary
            transits and progressions to see if any favourable or challenging
            aspects align with a {`person's`} natal chart during the exam
            period. They might interpret these aspects as influencing the{" "}
            {`individual's`} exam performance. The position of the planets keeps
            on changing in the birth chart thus the educational success also
            varies from one specific period to the other.

          <p className="mt-[15px] mt-[15px] text-[18px] font-bold">
            ● Favourable Lunar Phase
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            The lunar phase is simply associated with the position of the moon
            at the time of the native's educational course or the happening of
            the exam. This is known as the crucial period of educational or
            examination success for the native and thus astrologers pay
            attention to the phase of the Moon at the time of an exam. For
            example, a waxing Moon might be seen as a time of growth and
            building, potentially indicating a good period for success.
