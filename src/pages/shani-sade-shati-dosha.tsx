          <p className=" text-3xl font-bold">What is Shani Sade Sati?</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Shani sade sati is an Astrological phenomenon or the event in which
            the Shani or the Saturn makes its 7-and-a-half-year transit in a
            particular zodiac sign. The Sade sati begins for a particular zodiac
            when Saturn enters the 12th sign from the moon sign of birth.
            Similarly, this dashdatas when Saturn leaves the 2nd sign from the
            moon sign of birth. Saturn is known to be the most ferocious,
            significant and slowest-moving planet. It can stay in one zodiac
            sign for over 2 and a half years which is more than the duration of
            any other planet. During its stay in the particular zodiac sign it
            affects all the aspects of a {`native's`} life in both the positive
            and the negative manners as per {`one's`} deeds.

          <p className=" text-3xl font-bold">Significance of Shani Sade Sati</p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            Shani Sade Sati in the Hindu or Vedic astrology mythology is known
            as one of the most significant phenomena. This is simply because
            this data can affect the life of the native on all fronts. For the
            same reason, one is never supposed to take Shani sade sati for
            granted or in a casual manner. Shani or Saturn is known as the
            planet of Karma and {`it's`} the planet that affects the native by
            the karma or deeds of that person. Saturn is also known as the
            planet of justice for its specific characteristics as it believes in
            returning the deeds of natives. Shani Sade Sati can affect health,
            career, finances, marriage and even the very personal and loving
            relationship with the close family.

            Influence/Impact of Shani Sade Sati
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            As we have discussed earlier Shani sade sati is immensely powerful
            to affect the nativess on all fronts of life. If the Shani sade sati
            is left untreated by the astrological remedies then it can change
            the whole existence of the native. The severity of Shani sade sati
            majorly depends upon the karma or deeds of the person. In some
            cases, Shani sade sati can even bring fruitful results if the native
            has good deeds in the deposit. There are three phases of Shani Sade
            Sati which comprise the whole duration of 7 and half years. Here
            below we are listing down all those 3 phases and how they affect the
            individual.

        <div className="mt-[25px]">
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[20px]">
            1. First Phase of Shani Sade Sati
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            This is the first phase of shani sade sati during which the
            phenomena gradually grows up with its effects. In this phase Sat,
            the urn trantransmitsthe 12th house from the moon to grow gradually
            towards its full maturity. This phase is also known as the predatory
            phase when the native will start feeling the subtle changes. The
            native will suddenly feel the personality changes as he gets
            detached from the close ones. The native will suddenly opt to live
            in an isolated environment from the usual environment. With this,
            the other changes in the personality of the person will also follow.
            We advise the self introspection to cope with this phase along with
            meditation and yoga
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[20px]">
            2. Second Phase of Shani Sade Sati
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            In the second phase of shani sade sati Saturn will transit in the
            natal moon sign. This is the actual period when the sade sati will
            get its full maturity along with all its effects or the impact on
            the life of natives. The native will start witnessing the sudden
            chaos on all fronts of life whether {`it's`} the career, finance,
            health, marriage the relationship with the family or spouse etc.
            During this time we advise the native to remain highly patient and
            not to take any big decision in some jiffy in the hands of
            circumstances around. The other thing that the native should do is
            to get in the acts of charity and the donations
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[20px]">
            3. Third Phase of Shani Sade Sati
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[10px] text-[18px]">
            The third and the last phase of Shani sade sati begins with the
            transit of Saturn in the 2nd house from the moon. This is the period
            when the impact of Shani sade sati will gradually start diminishing.
            By this period the natives would have learnt all the life lessons
            from this phenomena of Shani sade sati. The native is supposed to
            become full of wisdom after encountering all the various experiences
            in life. At the same time, Saturn will also bring opportunities for
            the natives to grow amidst them. It is the Golden period of this
            phase when the native can give a whole new direction to life.
